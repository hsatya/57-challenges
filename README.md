# 57-challenges with JavaScript

## 1 - Saying Hello

The “Hello, World” program is the first program you learn
to write in many languages, but it doesn’t involve any input.
So create a program that prompts for your name and prints
a greeting using your name.
Example Output
What is your name? Brian
Hello, Brian, nice to meet you!
Constraint
• Keep the input, string concatenation, and output separate.
Challenges
• Write a new version of the program without using any
variables.
• Write a version of the program that displays different
greetings for different people.

## 2 - Counting the Number of Characters

Create a program that prompts for an input string and displays
output that shows the input string and the number of
characters the string contains.
Example Output
What is the input string? Homer
Homer has 5 characters.
Constraints
• Be sure the output contains the original string.
• Use a single output statement to construct the output.
• Use a built-in function of the programming language to
determine the length of the string.
Challenges
• If the user enters nothing, state that the user must enter
something into the program.
• Implement this program using a graphical user interface
and update the character counter every time a key is
pressed. If your language doesn’t have a particularly
friendly GUI library, try doing this exercise with HTML
and JavaScript instead.

## 3 - Printing Quotes

Quotation marks are often used to denote the start and end
of a string. But sometimes we need to print out the quotation
marks themselves by using escape characters.
Create a program that prompts for a quote and an author.
Display the quotation and author as shown in the example
output.
Example Output
What is the quote? These aren't the droids you're looking for.
Who said it? Obi-Wan Kenobi
Obi-Wan Kenobi says, "These aren't the droids
you're looking for."
Constraints
• Use a single output statement to produce this output,
using appropriate string-escaping techniques for quotes.
• If your language supports string interpolation or string
substitution, don’t use it for this exercise. Use string
concatenation instead.
Challenge
• In Chapter 7, Data Structures, on page 63, you’ll practice
working with lists of data. Modify this program so that
instead of prompting for quotes from the user, you create
a structure that holds quotes and their associated
attributions and then display all of the quotes using the
format in the example. An array of maps would be a
good choice.
